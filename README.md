# Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data
In this assignment, we have analyzed school data to help the school board and the mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. We have analyzed the district-wide standardized test results and aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Scope of Assignment
The codes and the resulting calculations in this assignment have generated the following information:
	snapshot of the district's key metrics,
	summary of key metrics about each school,
	list of highest performing schools and lowest performing schools by overall passing,
	average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school,
	average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school,
	school performance based on average spending ranges (per student),
	school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large), and
	school performance based on the "School Type".

# Summary of the analysis findings (results)
The key findings from the analysis are presented as follows:
	High spending per student does not lead to higher average scores or to an increased percentage of passing students.
	Charter schools perform better than district schools- this is in line with the above-mentioned result. District schools have a higher total school budget but average scores of students and percentage of passing students is higher in Charter schools.
	For spending rate (per student) greater than $630, results (average scores and percentage of students passing) decrease.
	For school size greater than 2000, results of student average score and student passing percentage decrease.

Tutor guidance and support was also helpful in correcting the code to set the average spending ranges.
